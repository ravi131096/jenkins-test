## 2. Pipeline Creation
Task: Create a Jenkins pipeline using a Jenkinsfile.

Could you write a Jenkinsfile for a simple CI/CD pipeline that includes stages for building, testing, and deploying a Java application? 
Please ensure it uses a declarative syntax and includes appropriate steps for each stage. 
What considerations would you take into account for error handling and notifications?

Use echo 'Stage...' to simulate the stage output

pipeline{
  agent{
      docker
     }
stages
    {
  stage(Build){
    script
         {
           sh(echo "Build")
         }
     }
  stage(Testing){
     script
       {
         sh(echo "Testing")
       }
   stage(Deploy){
     script
       {
        sh(echo "Deploy")
       }
    }
}
