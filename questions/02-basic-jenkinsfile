## 2. Pipeline Creation
Task: Create a Jenkins pipeline using a Jenkinsfile.

Could you write a Jenkinsfile for a simple CI/CD pipeline that includes stages for building, testing, and deploying a Java application? 
Please ensure it uses a declarative syntax and includes appropriate steps for each stage. 
What considerations would you take into account for error handling and notifications?

Use echo 'Stage...' to simulate the stage output
